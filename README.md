# CodesForces-Solution
This repository contains my solutions to Codeforces problems.
The goal is not just to store code, but to document my problem-solving approach and implementation decisions.  
Languages used: C++ and C
Focus areas: - Data Structures - Algorithms - Problem-solving patterns  
I update this repository regularly as I practice on Codeforces.
